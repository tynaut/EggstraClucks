    "by Finley Ecks
    
Some may seek the adventures, or exotic treasures; and others may venture out to battle evil. I was just searching for a quiet planet to discover new creatures and crops, and to start up a simple farm. My diaries are a collection of my findings, and some basic farm knowledge.",

    "Eggs
    
I was fortunate to have brought a few chicken eggs on my journey. While I can think up many ways I enjoy eating an egg, my plan was to raise chickens. To turn those eggs into chickens takes an investment of time and care.",

    "Egg Incubator
    
I crafted an incubator for my eggs. It provides warmth and security to the eggs, and eventually, eggs will hatch into baby chicks. I included a little timer on my incubator so I could keep track of when the next egg would hatch.",

    "Chicks
    
For me, baby chicks are the least interesting part of farming. All you can do is wait for them to grow up to be chickens. Be sure to keep them out of harms way, I would hate to see one die.",

    "Chickens
    
Now that my chicks have grown into chickens, I need to start feeding them. Chickens will happily eat the seeds from the crops I'm growing on my farm, but I've found it is a better use of my resources to craft up some animal feed for them.",

    "Animal Feed
    
Animals need grain and roughage in their diet. I grind up seeds, wheat, or corn, and mix in some plant fibres for roughage. When I have leftover straw, I find that works as well. Lastly, I add a little grit to help them digest the food.",

    "Hand Mill
    
I use a hand mill to grind seeds down to make my animal feed. It also grinds cobblestone and gravel into grit. There are plenty of things that I can grind with this great tool.",

    "Collection Bin
    
Soon after raising a few chickens, I was contacted by an apex man. He took an interest in buying any chickens I was willing to sell, and perhaps some produce. His instructions were to craft a collection bin, and leave it outside for him to pick up anything I wished to sell. So far he always stops by in the evening when I'm out in the garden. I'm going to make an effort to meet him one day.",

    "Chicken Nest
    
Chickens will lay an egg just about anywhere, not the brightest of creatures. But I have learned that if I build them a cozy nest with straw, they'll usually deposit eggs there.",

    "Feed Bin
    
Unlike me, chickens don't care about eatting off the ground. Still, I find that putting their food in a bin keeps it safe, and makes it last longer."
