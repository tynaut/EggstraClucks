    "by Finley Ecks
    
I've been making a lot of progress with my chickens and crops, and recently received several messages from some of the apex I was contacted by when I started up the farm. They seem most eager for me to send more chickens, unfortunately, chickens take awhile to grown. I'm still trying to get my two to lay more eggs, and once I do, I'm looking forward to the money I'll make.",

    "Chicken Cage
    
I've crafted a chicken cage now to sell off one of my chickens. After placing the cage on the ground, if I can manage to chase a chicken toward it, I can capture her. This is also a useful way for me to transport my chickens around the farm, since they aren't the easiest to herd. If I wanted to let the chicken out, I could place the cage on the ground and open it.",

    "Bundles
    
While the apex are mostly eager for a few chickens, I've discovered they've set up a settlement on a planet that doesn't have much vegetation, and are willing to buy some food. I've package up a bundle of food with some leftover straw from the farm, and placed it in the collection bin.",

    "Tamed Monsters
    
I took a day off today to forage in the forest. While I was out to examine the plant life, I came across a few strange creatures. They seemed rather docile, so I began wondering if I could raise them on the farm. I managed to capture two of them with a Capture Pod. Once I bring the creatures back to the farm, I'll see if I can find a use for them.",
    
    "Taming Crate
    
With the two creatures I captured, I constructed a taming crate. I've placed the capture pods inside, and I'm sure after they spend some time in their, they could be tamed and used around the farm.",
    
    "Livestock Resources
    
I have successfully tamed the creatures! Now that they've been feeding and are generally well manner, I've spent some time grooming their beautiful wool coats. After it's had some time to grow, I could use a pair of shears to remove some of their fur. I also noticed one of them seems to be producing a milky substance, so I fashioned a tool for milking. I hope it is safe to drink.",

    "Pheromones
    
I received a set of blueprints which outline some interesting scanning technology. With these alien creatures, I'm not entirely sure how to tell if they are male or female, milking or pregnant, or just generally hungry. This scanner makes their pheromones sparkle, and I'm slowly learning how to read the flickers of light. I've also crafted a hand-held version to separate the males from the females.",
    
    "Dinner Bell
    
I thought I might try out a little classical conditioning on my livestock. I've crafted a small iron bell, and they all seem to be drawn to the sound. I just give it a ring and they all come running!",
    
    "Tasty Treats
    
Occasionally I have a little trouble getting one of my creatures apart from the herd. I made a few tasty treats for them, which I always carry around. One tasty treat will have a tamed creature following me around for a bit, while I lead it to a better spot.",
    
    "Cows
    
After a long day of working on the farm, the goods I've been selling always seem to be gone and replaced by pixels. This evening was the first chance I had to run into the shippers. Although they were talking in hushed whispers when I approached, and quickly got silent, after a few scrutinizing glances, they seemed to warm up to me. After I had a brief conversation with them about goods, they mentioned they had a few cows to sell.",

    "According to the apex, there were a few cows that had been moved to the planet I've been sending my goods too. Now that earth has been destroyed, there aren't that many Earth Cows remaining. They think it would be a good idea to breed them, and eventually sell some back to them, since they could soon become extinct. Once I have enough pixels to afford a male and female cow, I shall have to give it a try."
